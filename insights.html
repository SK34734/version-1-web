<!-- put this in "Our Support" instead maybe? -->
<p> A while back, I participated in a summer program dedicated towards offering students
with guidance as to how they can help their community. Growing up, I heard many teachers
state how the lack of funding they receive, creates barriers for the students. This
compelled me to fundraise and gather supplies for local teachers. </p>

<p> Along the way, I have learned what encourages funds, and the collection of supplies. Before we begin,
<strong> please contact your schools principal or school administration to confirm you are allowed to ask for funds.</strong> If
this is not allowed, ask if you are allowed to receive donations from others for school supplies. </p>
<!-- add how the non-profit can work with you for this campaign, wheter it's through helping you with your own campaign
or directly gathering funds and supplies (which is the preferred/first method, the latter is if they dont feel comfortable
with someone else handling the campaign), add this in grant section? -->

<!-- Please make this slightly bigger! --> <p> <strong> Here's what works: a well-planned fundraiser, school supply drive, and grants. </strong></p>

    A strategic fundraiser <!-- center this -->
</h1>


<h5> Step 1: Set up a fundraiser </h5>
<div>
    I highly recommend creating a fundraiser to gather funds for supplies!

    The best websites for this are <strong> DonorsChoose, Adopt-A-Classroom, Classful, PledgeCents, </strong> or <strong>GoFundMe</strong>.
    These websites are dedicated towards supporting educators, and providing them with spaces to help them
    earn supplies.
</div>

<h5> Step 2: Promotion </h5>
<div>
    <strong> The most effective ways to quickly earn funds are: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li> Dine-In Events/Community Outreach </li> <!-- emphasize calling businesses and newspaper editors to talk about this rather than just emailing -->
        <li> Media Promotion </li> <!-- you should include social media AND newspaper coverage for this -->
        <li> Connections </li>
    </ul>

    <strong> Strategies I have found to be uneffective: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li> Flyers </li>
        <li> Directly asking businesses for funds</li>
        <li> Setting up fundraisers across different sites</li>

        (After tracking scans on flyers, I have found that many people do not take the time to look at one.
        It is not worth the effort.)
        (Many businesses are also unlikely to directly give your fundraiser donations.)
        (Setting up multiple fundraisers this way is unneeded effort, as people will often choose to only donate to one.)
    </ul>

<!-- make buttons bigger in js or css idk -->
<!-- DO THIS FOR EVERY STEP -->
<div>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong> Create a list of local businesses </strong> </li>
        Reach out to restaurants, mom and pop shops, community-owned businesses, etc.

        <li> <strong> Create a list of local libraries and malls </strong> </li>

        <li> <strong> Reach out to them! </strong> </li>
        <ul> Ask restaurants if you can host dine-in events </ul>
            You bring in new customers, they state that they have come to support your fundraiser.
            Partial amounts of the money generated goes to your fundraiser.

            Always CALL restaurants to ask! If their manager is not available, call again near a later time.

            <li> <a href="DineIn-template.html">
                <button id="answer3">Template For Calling Restaurants</button>
            </a> </li>

        <ul> Ask libraries or malls for promotion of your fundraiser, or to host a school supply drive!</ul>
        If they decline, politely ask if they may refer you to any other store or business who may be willing to support you.

        <li> <a href="mall-template.html">
            <button id="answer4">Template For Calling Malls</button>
        </a> </li>

        <li> <strong> Many restaurants or other places may only allow organizations to host such events. If this is the case, feel
        free to contact us, and we may be able to work with you to set up an event under our name (all profits available from the
        event would still proceed to the fundraiser). </strong> </li>

        <li> Do not lose hope. </li>
        Try to spend some time each day reaching out to these businesses. Many will decline, but all it takes is one "yes".
        This will set you and your fundraiser up for success. Give yourself a long period of time to fundraise (1-5 months
        depending on how much you want to raise), and you will come across people who are motivated to support your efforts.
        Keep having faith in what you are doing!
    </ol>
</div>

<h6> Step 2b: Media Promotion </h6>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li> Post your fundraiser on social media </li>
        I recommend making a facebook post, posting this on facebook groups, and making a post on
        TikTok and/or Instagram. If you do not want to make a direct post, then post a story periodically
        on Instagram.

        <li> Reach out to local newspapers </li>
        I recommend googling who the editor for your local newspaper is, and directly calling them to ask
        if they could promote your fundraiser on their newspaper.

        <li> <a href="call-to-editor-template.html">
            <button id="answer5">Template For Calling Editor</button>
            </a>
        </li>

        <!-- will be what they can use to write a letter to community asking for support in newspaper -->
        <li> <a href="newspaper-promotion-template.html">
            <button id="answer6">Template For Newspaper Promotion</button>
        </a> </li>

    </ol>
</div>

<h6> Step 2c: Connections </h6>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li> Directly share your fundraiser</li>
        Share your fundraiser with friends, family, and others. Ask them for donations, and mention
        how their donation would create a meaningful impact on the classroom.
    </ol>
</div>

<h5> Step 3: Repeat </h5>
<div>
    Continue these steps until you reach your goal! I recommend setting up a weekly schedule, with certain
    days dedicated to certain tasks to complete, or deadlines for these tasks.

    <!-- maybe do a sample chart for a weekly schedule? include a filled example and one unfilled for them to copy and paste,
    figure out how to put charts in html -->
</div>

<h1> School Supply Drive </h1>

<p> Hosting a school supply drive can be a great way to earn supplies for your classroom without spending your own money. Follow the
steps below to successfully host a school supply drive in your local community!</p>

<h2> Step 1: Plan out the drive </h2>
<p> Certain places may not be willing to host a supply drive for a singular person. If this is the case,
contact us so that we may reach out to them, and state that the drive is under our organization. The donations received
will be directly donated to you or anyone else you wish to set up the drive for.

They may also require donations to be for multiple teachers. If this is the case, you can reach out to your schools adminstration
to ask if you can host a supply drive for the school, or you could opt for the fundraiser or grants route. You can contact us for more guidance.
We may be willing to directly donate to you, or ship over supplies. </p>
