My project is called Aid For Educators, and it serves to support teachers by providing them with resources and stratgies. I made this project after thinking about this after I attended a summer
program that encouraged me to help the community. I made the project by drafting out the layout and the important aspects I want the user to find (grants or templates), and then coded it out. 
I struggled with coding out my ideas to life, such as the modal. I had to scour the internet to figure out how to create an interactive modal and properly display it. This ended up taking most of my time, along with figuring out how to make the html pages look neater. I did not have much experience in CSS before this. I learned how important having creative skills are 
when coding websites.
